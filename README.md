# HASH-verify
Verify file hashes of downloaded files easily in a GUI

## What it does...
This gui based Python3 app calculates 3 types of file hashes and can evaluate if a hash matches.

This is usable, when you download a file from a webpage. Often you also receive a hash value in order to check that the downloaded file has not been tempered with.

Supported hash types:

* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA256
* SHA3_256

## Running the app
* Python3
* pip3 install PySimpleGUI

./hasher.py
